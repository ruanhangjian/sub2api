# Asynchronous Image Tasks

Asynchronous image tasks let clients submit long-running OpenAI-compatible image requests without keeping one HTTP connection open. This avoids proxy/CDN response timeouts such as Cloudflare 524 while preserving the existing image routing, billing, moderation, concurrency, and failover behavior.

## Endpoints

The authenticated gateway exposes both `/v1` paths and their existing no-prefix aliases:

```text
POST /v1/images/generations/async
POST /v1/images/edits/async
GET  /v1/images/tasks/{task_id}
GET  /v1/images/tasks/{task_id}/files/{filename}
```

The aliases are `/images/generations/async`, `/images/edits/async`, and `/images/tasks/{task_id}`.

OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini groups are supported. OpenAI/Grok requests use the same JSON or multipart payload as the corresponding Images endpoint. Gemini accepts either an OpenAI Chat Completions image request (`model` + `messages`) or a native Gemini request (`model` + `contents`). Streaming requests are rejected because a polled task returns one final JSON result.

## Durable execution and storage

Asynchronous image tasks are enabled by default. PostgreSQL is the source of truth for task state and request snapshots; Redis is only the ready queue. The runtime starts 60 workers by default, restores queued work after a restart, and deliberately does not replay an interrupted `processing` task because the upstream may already have accepted it.

Generated image bytes never enter PostgreSQL or Redis. Local storage under `./data/image-storage` is the zero-configuration default. Files and task records are retained for 24 hours and cleaned every hour. Complete S3 credentials take precedence when configured.

### From the admin UI (recommended)

**Admin → Backup → Async image object storage.** Saving the form takes effect immediately — the object-storage client is rebuilt on the next request, so there is no container restart.

Because the async image storage and the database backup share one S3 client, the form defaults to **reusing the backup S3 configuration**: it borrows the endpoint, region and credentials already configured above and keeps only its own bucket and prefix, so backups stay under `backups/` while images go to `images/`. Leave the bucket empty to use the backup bucket as well. Untick the box to point images at a completely separate account.

Saving requires step-up 2FA when that gate is enabled, for the same reason the backup S3 form does: changing the target redirects generated content to another account.

Turning the switch off stops new submissions but keeps already-accepted tasks pollable, so nothing in flight is stranded.

### From the config file

The admin setting takes precedence. When nothing has ever been saved there, the `image_storage` block in `config.yaml` is used instead, so deployments that enabled the feature before the admin UI existed keep working untouched.

The default configuration is:

```yaml
async_image:
  enabled: true
  worker_concurrency: 60
  retention_hours: 24
  cleanup_interval_minutes: 60

image_storage:
  enabled: true
  local_enabled: true
  local_directory: "./data/image-storage"
  local_base_url: "/v1/images/tasks"
  retention_hours: 24
  cleanup_interval_minutes: 60
  # Optional S3-compatible storage; complete credentials make S3 take priority.
  endpoint: "https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"  # AWS 官方可留空
  region: "auto"
  bucket: "my-images"
  access_key_id: "..."
  secret_access_key: "..."
  prefix: "images/"
  force_path_style: false          # MinIO/path-style buckets set true
  public_base_url: ""              # set to return public_base_url/key直链; empty → presigned URL
  presign_expiry_hours: 24         # presigned link TTL when public_base_url is empty
  max_download_bytes: 33554432     # cap when re-hosting an upstream image URL (32MB)
```

When a task completes, each generated image is written to the selected storage and the result is rewritten to a compact form. OpenAI `b64_json`, Gemini native `inlineData`, and Gemini Chat markdown data URLs are all replaced by stored URLs. Only the compact JSON is persisted. If storage fails, the task is marked `failed` rather than persisting raw base64.

To support a different vendor beyond the S3-compatible client, implement the `service.ImageStorage` interface (`Save(ctx, key, contentType, data) (url, error)`) and provide it in place of the S3 implementation.

### Troubleshooting: the endpoints return 404 after enabling

`404 async image tasks are not enabled` means `async_image.enabled`/`image_storage.enabled` is off, or neither local nor S3 storage resolved successfully. The route exists either way; the 404 comes from the handler.

Check the startup log for:

```text
WARN image_storage.enabled is true but object storage is not fully configured; async image tasks are disabled  missing_keys=[...]
```

`missing_keys` names exactly which credentials were empty when the config was loaded.

Note that releases **before v0.1.161 silently dropped `IMAGE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, `_BUCKET`, `_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`** when they were supplied only through the environment: those keys had no registered default, and viper cannot see an environment variable for a key it does not already know about. Deployments driven purely by `environment:` — which is what `deploy/docker-compose.yml` does by default — therefore reported `enabled: true` with empty credentials and 404'd on every async call. On an affected release the workaround is to also place the `image_storage` block in `/app/data/config.yaml` (copy it from `deploy/config.example.yaml`); once the keys exist in the file, the environment overrides apply normally.

Two further causes of a 404 that are unrelated to storage: the API key's group must be on the **OpenAI, Grok, or Gemini** platform, and a task may only be polled with the **same API key that submitted it**. Polling with a different key of the same user returns `image task not found` by design.

## Submit a task

```bash
curl -i https://api.example.com/v1/images/generations/async \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "prompt": "A lighthouse during a winter storm",
    "size": "1536x1024"
  }'
```

The server saves the task in PostgreSQL, freezes the estimated balance charge when applicable, enqueues it in Redis, and responds with `202 Accepted`:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "queued",
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "expires_at": 1784179200,
  "poll_url": "/v1/images/tasks/imgtask_0123456789abcdef"
}
```

`Location` contains the polling path and `Retry-After: 3` provides the recommended polling interval.

## Poll a task

Use the same API key that submitted the task:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/images/tasks/imgtask_0123456789abcdef \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-...'
```

While work is in progress:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "processing",
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "expires_at": 1784179200
}
```

On success, `result` mirrors the synchronous image API body, except each image has been offloaded to object storage: `data[].url` points at the stored object and `b64_json` is stripped (so both URL and base64 upstream formats end up as compact stored links):

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "completed",
  "http_status": 200,
  "image_url": "https://...",
  "result": {
    "created": 1784092923,
    "data": [{"url": "https://..."}]
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "completed_at": 1784092923,
  "expires_at": 1784179323
}
```

For URL responses, `image_url` mirrors the first `data[].url` for simple clients. On failure, the task reaches `failed` and exposes the original OpenAI-compatible error object where available:

```json
{
  "id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "task_id": "imgtask_0123456789abcdef",
  "object": "image.generation.task",
  "status": "failed",
  "http_status": 502,
  "error": {
    "type": "api_error",
    "message": "Upstream request failed"
  },
  "created_at": 1784092800,
  "completed_at": 1784092923,
  "expires_at": 1784179323
}
```

All submit and poll responses include `Cache-Control: no-store`, preventing a CDN from caching the queued/processing state. Tasks and results expire after 24 hours. A task executes for at most 30 minutes.

The balance hold is an admission guard, not a second settlement path. It is released idempotently immediately before execution; the internal request then traverses the normal gateway route, where existing SubPilot scheduling, user/account concurrency, failover, usage recording, and actual model/count/resolution billing remain authoritative.

Task ownership is scoped to both user and API key. Unknown task IDs and IDs owned by another key both return `404`, avoiding task-existence disclosure. Polling remains available when the completed generation used the key's remaining balance; normal authentication, disabled-key, user, IP, and group checks still apply.
